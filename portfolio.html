                Offering features like task listing, addition, and user sharing,
                the app provides a user-friendly interface with a clear and
                modern design. The frontend utilizes React, TypeScript, Styled
                Components, and React Query, while the backend relies on the
                JSONPlaceholder REST API for tasks and users. Installation is
                straightforward, and the app promises a seamless experience for
                managing personal or work-related tasks. 🚀📝
